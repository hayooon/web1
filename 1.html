  <p>Yo Marvin, stop calling Sad Iverson is ballin In the corner of a room by himself <br>
  You are nothin' but an empty shell Every night, he goin' down to hell Fake love in a shit hotel <br>
  Can't believe how far he fell You weak on the floor so you call her cell "How you been?," "how you doing?" <br>
  You been good? I been drinkin' Way too much, you'd think that I'd be over you <br>
  Over you, over you (8 calls, all you) But I think about it every day, yeah <br>
  Yeah, I never missed her anyways Yeah, I never missed her anyways (Yeah-eah-eah)</p>

  Same crew but another mistress Every day, every night getting wasted</p>
